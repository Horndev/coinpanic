## Forks

The roots of the website are in claiming forks from the main BTC blockchain.  Many of the forked coins require users to download the entire blockchain, using the forked client, and this could be a time-intensive and error prone process.  This website was created to be able to transfer coins on the forked blockchains by generating correctly formatted transactions, and broadcast those transactions to the forked network.

## Lightning Network

The website provides some Bitcoin mainnet Lightning network applications

### LN Faucet (Community Jar)
