<h2>Ways to claim</h2>

<h3>You sign transaction</h3>

<p>Does not require you to have a full blockchain download.</p>
<p>Does not require you to divulge your private keys.</p>
<p>Supports SegWit P2SH-P2WPKH addresses (those starting with a '3')</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>You provide us a list of your public addresses which you wish to claim from.</p>
<p>We will generate an unsigned transaction.</p>
<p>You download the client for the coin, import your private keys locally, and sign the transaction.</p>
<p>Send us the signed transaction, and we broadcast it on the network for you.</p>
<hr />
<p>* This is not yet automated, so we have to do this manually for you.</p>

<h3>You provide us your private keys</h3>

<p>We can import your coins and send them to an address of your choice (probably an exchange deposit address)</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>You securely provide us your private keys.</p>
<p>We scan the blockchain, and transmit the coins as you desire.</p>
<br />
<p>* This mode is the least secure.</p>
